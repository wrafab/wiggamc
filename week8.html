<h1> Wiggam Week 8: Sewing and Embroidery </h1>
  
<h3> For these couple classes we worked on pillow cases. Before we could sew a pillow we had to learn how to learn a sewing
  machine. We started with a peice of blank cloth and then began to work. Once I got comfortable with the electronic sewing machine, I picked my cloth.
  After grabbing 3 different size peices of cloth, I had to start assembling them. Once laid in the right order, We had to put pins in the cloth
  to hold them in the right place. This was finally done And I began to sew the edges which closed up the peice of cloth to make it a pillow case. 
  My design had minions on it with a floral pink strip. </h3>
