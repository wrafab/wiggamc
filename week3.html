<h1>Wiggam Week 3: Garment, Sublimation, UV Printing</h1>
  
  <h3> In this week we started to expand to multiple machines. First we madea t-shirt to either represent Hudson or Western Reserve
  Academy. Secondly we used the UV Printer in which I made a golf ball. Lastly, we used sublimation in which I designed a gaming mousepad. This 
  mousepad was designed with a CSGO "fire and ice" theme with my favorite teams and gaming companies bordering the mousepad. It
  was completed with my gamertag at the bottom.</h3>
