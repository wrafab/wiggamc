<h1> Wiggam Week 6: Lamination, Vacuum Forming, Molding & Casting </h1>
  
<h3> During this week we were introduced to mkaing skateboards and a mold. To be smart about time, I started with my skateboard. 
  I grabbed the normal skateboard mold and began glueing my pieces together. I would put wood glue on a piece, smooth it out and
  continue to do the same and stack them until they were all aligned. Then I took the board and put it in a a bag which I then
  had to continually pump out air for about 2 minutes. The board began to bend due to lack of air and I put it aside to dry for the night.
 Then I worked on my mold. I downloaded a Newcastle United crest from thingiverse.com. I put this crest in meshmixer and then exported it as an stl.</h3>
