<h3> For this week we worked on 3D Printing. We started out by getting our head scanned by a friend and then saved that file as a stl. 
 After working on our face on Meshmixer we would then attach to a body of our choosing. After that we have to convert the file to 
  a Makerbot file to be able to 3D print it. For my project I printed my head on a robotic body.</h3>
