<h1>Wiggam Week 5:  3D Printing and Scanning</h1>
<h3> For this week we worked on 3D Printing. We started out by getting our head scanned by a friend and then saved that file as a stl. 
 After working on our face on Meshmixer we would then attach to a body of our choosing. After that we have to convert the file to 
  a Makerbot file to be able to 3D print it. For my project I printed my head on a robotic body.
 3D printing is very useful but there are many limitations. You can only make things out of certain materials and ours is only
 plastic which can be very brittle. Also the 3D printer builds from the ground up, it needs to construct supports if something is hanging
 off the object. 
 Process: The process I used was first somebody took a file of my head. After that I put my head on Meshmixer
 and filled in any holes that might have been there from the film process. Then I went on google chrome and found a robotic body
 to put my head on. Using Meshmizer, I put my head on the robotic body and linked the two items together. After that I put the
 file on Makerbot so I could print it.</h3>
