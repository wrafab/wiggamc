<h1>Wiggam Week 2: CAD, Fusion 360 and Design</h1>
  
  <h3> In this section we learned to use Fusion 360. We started out getting used to the challenging software and then took on our own project. 
    For my project I made a headphone stand to put on my desk along with the CSGO logo engraved on the top. 
  Narrative: This project taught me how to maneuver in Fusion 360. I started by created ractangles and then piecing them together
  in the shape of my headphone stand. I then extruded the item to give it depth and to make it 3D. I used the chamber and fillet tools to
  round off my edges and to make the item look more friendly and contemporary. </h3>
