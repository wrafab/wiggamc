<h1>Wiggam Week 1:  Principles of Digital Fabrication, Design Challenges and HTML</h1>
<h3> In the first class we learned the basics of Digital Fabrication. Following that, We were instructed to build a contraption of only a couple straws
 and an inch of tape. We were timed to build this and the goal was to drop a golf ball on it from 2 feet and that the ball would rest in 
  the contraption. We were also timed to build the tallest building possible from a newspaper and limited tape. These challenges
  taught us to be resourceful and witty. We ended the class period talking about HTML and coding which is what I'm doing now. </h3>
