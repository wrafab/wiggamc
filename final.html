<h1>Wiggam Final Project</h1>
  
  <h3> 1. Describe your project.
    For my project I decided to make my own soccer team. I based this team off of my hometown since I spent much of my soccer career
    learning and playing endless nights at the Wooster soccer fields. The crest design is influenced by a mixture of Spanish clubs and the 
    rural roots of Wooster, Ohio.
  

2. What equipment and materials did you use to create the project.
    I made the ultimate Wooster United Fan Pack. This includes a 2018/19 Wooster United Home Jersey (C.WIGGAM#9), a Wooster United
    water bottle, and a Wooster United hat. For the jersey I used the Brother Gt-3 Series printer. For the water bottle I used the
    Epilog Fusion M2 laser printer.

3. How much time did you spend working on the project?
    This project took 4 whole class periods. Most of the first period was spent creating a design. I had to think about the main colors,
    the crest, etc. I decided to choose royal blue and gold, traditional Wooster colors. If you notice, there is a golden wreath of wheat
    surrounding the "W" and "U" paying homage to the deep rural roots of Wooster that I grew up with. After that I had to finalize the crest and 
    print the rest of the items.

4. What settings and configurations did you use on each machine.
    

5. What did you learn from this project?
    I learned that innovation drives the world. Creating becomes easier because people created these machines. This will lead
    to more creativity by us and we will make machines that create even greater products in the future. Business is changing because of
    technology and this class was enjoyable and informative in the process of innovation.

7. Please document each step of your project including photographs and include ALL project files.</h3>
