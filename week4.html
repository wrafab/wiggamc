<h1>Wiggam Week 4: Laser Cutting and Engraving and Woodshop</h1>
  
  <h3> In this rotation we worked with certain objects and then we proceeded to cut into them. For laser cutting I chose a sticakble pocket that goes on
  the back of your phone for credit cards. Using the machine, I laser cut the University of Akron logo on it. For the Engraving and Woodshop 
  I made a clock. This clock sported a giant "F" for my favorite gaming team which is FaZe Clan. It was colored with their colors: red, yellow, and blue. </h3>
